## Introduction

User authentication is an essential component of many software systems, ensuring that only authorized users have access to their accounts or sensitive information. This project provides a basic implementation of user management/authentication using Horner's rule for polynomial evaluation hash code with the method of separate chaining to avoid collisions to efficiently manage user credentials. 

## Features

- User account creation
- User login and authentication
- Password modification
- Random password generation
- Text file-based storage of user credentials

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. For better usage use CLion IDE and clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new project and add the repo to the project.
3. Run the program
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform actions such as creating a user, logging in, modifying passwords, generating passwords, and retrieving users.
**NOTE**: The program will output an error warning if the **users.txt** is not created but don't worry! upon creating a user the program automatically creates that text file for you!
